# DiscogsAPI

This was a project I worked on alone in Server Side programming to implement an API of my own choosing into a C# console application. 
My process to do this was to first identify the requirements I needed in my console application. I then created a design of my application using a UML diagram. Following my design I began implementing my application in C#. After some unit testing and ensuring the API and console work as they should, I added the project to this repository.
